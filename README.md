> ([Select portuguese](README-ptBR.md))

This was a project made during the course **Be Full-Stack with Asp.NET Core, Angular + EF Core**, but with the addition of some features not taught during the course, but which are part of my knowledge and experience as a developer for over 9 years. Below are listed all the technologies used for the development of the project and also a brief explanation:

 - Vagrant: used to automate database creation
   postgres on a virtual machine (VirtualBox)
 - Angular: used in the development of the frontend and that makes the
   communication with services
 - Entity Framework: ORM used for communication and management of
   database transactions
 - Bootstrap: frontend framework used to facilitate the
   layout development with CSS and component styling
